# BlueOS Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v1.0

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering a welcoming environment, we believe in an open and inclusive community. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all who participate in our project, as well as the steps to report unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and harassment-free environment for everyone.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Treat yourself and others with kindness, respect, and empathy
- Acknowledge your own worth and the worth of others
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Approach interactions with a positive attitude
- Ensure everyone feels safe and included
- Be mindful of how your words and actions affect others
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Celebrate differences and learn from each other
- Offer support and assistance when needed
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
BlueOS maintainers, project participants, and contributors (collectively, “participants”) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

As the primary project maintainer, Blue Robotics has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

# Reporting and Enforcement
Report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers (software@bluerobotics.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Consequences for violations may include temporary or permanent bans from the project.

# Conclusion
### By participating in this project, you agree to uphold this Code of Conduct. Let's work together to create a community where everyone feels safe and welcome, with self-love, respect, inclusivity, positivity, and accountability.
