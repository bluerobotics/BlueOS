Welcome to BlueOS 1.3!

What you currently see is a tmux session built into BlueOS's docker container.
This means you are not in the host Raspbian OS itself, and most of the data in here is
not-persistent, except for things in /root/.config, although you should not store your data there.

USAGE NOTES:
To check all running services, press ctrl+b, then s. This will show all current sessions,
and is helpful for checking the state of individual services, restarting them, and checking their verbose outputs.

To split the screen horizontally, press ctrl+b then %
To split the screen vertically  press ctrl+b then "
To switch tabs, click them or press ctrl+b then use the directional keys in the keyboard

To login into the Raspberry Pi itself, do `red-pill`.

Happy Hacking!
